# Identify Fraud From Enron Email

## Project Overview

In this project, you will play detective, and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify 
Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

## Why this Project?

This project will teach you the end-to-end process of investigating data through a machine learning lens.

It will teach you how to extract and identify useful features that best represent your data, a few of the most commonly used 
machine learning algorithms today, and how to evaluate the performance of your machine learning algorithms.
