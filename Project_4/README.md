# Project Overview
In this project, you will use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques in a dataset of Red Wine quality ratings to discover 
relationships among multiple variables, and create explanatory visualizations illuminating distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

Why this Project?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the numerical and graphical examination of data characteristics and relationships before formal,
rigorous statistical analyses are applied.

EDA can lead to insights, which may uncover to other questions, and eventually predictive models. It also is an important
“line of defense” against bad data and is an opportunity to notice that your assumptions or intuitions about a data set are violated.

The dataset is public available for research. The details are described in [Cortez et al., 2009].
