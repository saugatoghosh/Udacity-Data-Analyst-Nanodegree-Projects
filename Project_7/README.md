# Create A Tableau Story

## Project Overview
For this project, you will create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. 
Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and 
effective communication.

##Why this Project?
This project will touch on the overarching attitudes and beliefs important to effective data visualization, such as:

- visualization is a dialog
- showcasing and sharing visualizations with others
- visualization is a fluid process that typically requires multiple iterations of improvements
- You will have an opportunity to experience the end-to-end process of creating effective data visualizations and highlighting important
  information from data that may otherwise be hidden or hard to uncover.
