# Step Into a Data Analyst's Shoes
In this project, youâ€™ll conduct an overview of what a data analyst does regularly. You'll investigate 
a raw dataset and share your findings using a Jupyter Notebook. Using real-life data provided by Bay Area Bike Share, 
you will determine differences in usage between commuters and tourists' ridership patterns, average duration of trips, and more!
